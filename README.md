A Halloween-themed memory card game that can be played in 3 difficulties.

- Players are forced to choose between easy, medium, or hard mode before the game will begin
- A countdown timer and amount of guesses left are granted based on the difficulty chosen
- Cards flip and remain in the same position when clicked
- When two cards match they stay flipped and are added to an array of correctly guessed cards
- Initialized with create-react-app and added confetti upon winning screen
- Winning/losing functionality operate by redirecting user to a different screen showcasing their result
- Stylized using TailwindCSS

## How To Use:

Choose a difficulty, press start, and then find the matching cards before your time or guesses run out!

## How I Could Improve The App:

- Add mobile responsiveness
- Whilst the code is functional, it is clunky, and could be cleaned up
